# Zendesk-Coding-Challenge
Coding challenge for an internship at Zendesk

In this coding challenge, I was required to:
  - Connect to the Zendesk API
  - Request all the tickets for my account
  - Display them in a list
  - Display individual ticket details
  - Page through tickets when more than 25 are returned

I decided to code this challenge using java and displaying the data using CLI.
